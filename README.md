# **Netflix Clone using React**

- ### It's basically a clone of NetFlix where user can see the latest, upcoming, action, comedy & horror movies.

- ### User can also watch the trailer or videos associated with the movie as we've embed youtube inside the app.

---

- ### Moto behind developing this app to have hands on API calls, testing, fetching the data from API.

---

- ### For the news data, I've used TheMovieDB

  - [TheMovieDB.org API](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

  ***

- ### For the data fetching , I've used axios i.e. npm package
  - [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
